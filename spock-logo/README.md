Spock Framework Logo
====================

This is a proposal for a Spock Framework Logo.

The following is the reasoning behind:

* Colors are taken from the shirt that Spock always wears in Start-Trek
* The S-logo is taken from the Star-Trek logo also on the shirts worn
* The logo shape is inspired by the Grails logo

I hope it's useful!

Feel free to use it as you please. It is here by given to the Spock Framework Community.
